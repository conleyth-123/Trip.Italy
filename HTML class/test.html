        <h1>Trip to Italy</h1>
        <p>This past summer my family and I made a trip to Italy. We went to meet up with my sister who just finished a study abroad. During thsi time we visited 3 cities.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Florance</li>
            <li>Sorrento/Amalfi Coast</li>
            <li>Rome</li>
        </ol>
    </main>
    <div>
        <p>Out of all these Amazing Cities in my opinion Florance was the best. Sorrento has beautiful landscapes, and the sea. Rome had alot of interesting architecture. Florance had it all, it had the Tuscany landscape, and the old architecture. I think the best part of Italy was how the cities were designed. Everything was squeezed together. What seemed like a sidewalk was also a road and a market. Also the city was coved in cobblestone roads which was awesome. In Rome you could be walking down a random street and come across a beautiful church with an amazing facade, it was amazing. I would definitely recomend trying to make a trip to Italy.
